## Dr TUI for Macos

Dr TUI is here to make your command-line life a lot easier. The command line isn’t actually that hard—but there are too many choices, and the defaults are pretty terrible. They’re fine if you want to live in a black-and-white world.

Dr TUI adds color, icons, and menus so your terminal finally makes visual sense. Instead of staring at a dull grey prompt full of strange letters and numbers, you get a clean, color-coded view and interactive menus that guide you. With Dr TUI, you can go from command-line novice to confident power user much faster—and actually enjoy the process.

Dr Tui will make your prompt colorful, and the files and folders will also be colorful.

When a file becomes $$\color{green}{Executable}$$ it will be green. so if you do a "chmod +x file", now you know visully which files are executables.
